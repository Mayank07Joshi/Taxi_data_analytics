# Uber_data_analytics

## Introduction
I undertook this project as part of learning the data life cycle. From cleaning of the data to dashboard creation, to accomplish this task I used various tools and techniques, including GCP Storage, Python, Compute Instance, Mage Data Pipeline Tool, BigQuery, and Power BI.

## Architecture

## Technology Used
  * Programming Language: Python
  * Google cloud platform
    1. Google Storage
    2. Compute Instance
    3. BigQuery
  * Mage AI (https://www.mage.ai/)
  * Power BI

## Data Used
The data used for this project was captured from **https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page**. The data used in this project is a very small sample comprising of only the yellow taxi data available on the aforementioned link. Also, the data corresponds to only the first 3 months of 2023 (Links are given below)

1. Website - https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page
2. Data Dictionary - https://www.nyc.gov/assets/tlc/downloads/pdf/data_dictionary_trip_records_yellow.pdf

TLC Trip Record Data Yellow taxi trip records include fields capturing pick-up and drop-off dates/times, pick-up and drop-off locations, trip distances, itemized fares, rate types, payment types, and driver-reported passenger counts.

## Data Model
Below is the data model theorized as part of the cleaning and getting-ready process. The dimension tables mentioned in the brpught versitality to the pipeline.
